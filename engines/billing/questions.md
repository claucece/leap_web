1. Should admin be able to see subscriptions?

2. Should user be able to upgrade or downgrade subscriptions?

3. Should confirmations emails be allowed?

4. Braintree uses JS for dropin. I'm not sure but this may not work in browsers
such as Tor. Is there a problem?
JS can be improved and changed to 'Hosted Fields'. See here:

5. There is another payment method that can be allowed: SEPA Direct Debit (on
   beta). Should it be allowed?
